Companion slides to the Relay Modern Course

## How to check it out

Go here: https://relay-modern-course.now.sh/packages/

## How to run it?

See `package.json`, there is one yarn script for each lesson

`yarn setup` is first one

`yarn simulated-defer` is the last one for now

## Are there videos to accompany the slides?
Not yet, if I receive enough donations to buy a microphone I will record the course.

Those who donate will receive the course for free.

## This is a course for a web client, is there a default server to be used with it?
Yes! Thanks to [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) you can get a server up and running easily!

Just go here: https://github.com/BigsonLvrocha/relay-modern-typescript-server and follow the instructions in the `README`.
